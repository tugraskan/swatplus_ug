!!@summary Placeholder subroutine for aquifer hydrodynamics calculations (currently inactive)
!!@description This subroutine is designed as a placeholder for future aquifer hydrodynamics calculations.
!! Currently, it contains no computational logic and simply returns immediately. The comment
!! "nothing from nothing leaves nothing" indicates this subroutine performs no operations
!! and is reserved for potential future implementation of advanced aquifer flow dynamics
!! or hydraulic calculations beyond the basic 1D flow model.
!!@arguments
!! None - this subroutine takes no input parameters
      subroutine aqu_hyds
  
      !! Placeholder subroutine - no computations performed
!!  nothing from nothing leaves nothing
      implicit none

      !! Return immediately without performing any calculations
      return
      end subroutine aqu_hyds
