       subroutine mgt_tillfactor(jj, bio_mix_event, emix,dtil)
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    ! Armen 16 January 2008
    ! This procedure increases tillage factor (tillagef(l,jj) per layer for each operation
    ! The tillage factor settling will depend of soil moisture (tentatively) and must be called every day
    ! For simplicity the settling is calculated now at the soil carbon subroutine because soil water content is available

    ! The tillage factor depends on the cumulative soil disturbance rating = csdr
    ! For simplicity, csdr is a function of emix
    ! First step is to calculate "current" csdr by inverting tillage factor function
    ! The effect of texture on tillage factor (ZZ) is removed first (and recovered at the end of the procedure)
    ! YY = tillagef(l,jj) / ZZ
    ! Since the tillage factor function is non linear, iterations are needed 
    ! XX = 0.5 is the initial value that works OK for the range of values observed
    ! If a layer is only partially tilled then emix is corrected accordingly
